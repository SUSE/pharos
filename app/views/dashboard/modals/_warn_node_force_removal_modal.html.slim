        p You are about to forcibly remove a node from the cluster. This action cannot be reversed.
          Any data on this node will be lost and the machine must be re-installed before it can be
          added back.

        p The operation will perform some basic tasks to maintain the coherence of the cluster, but
          it may not function normally afterwards.

        p Only proceed with this operation if you are certain it is essential to do so.
